📰 NLP Model for Stock News Sentiment Analysis
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment in financial news headlines. By classifying headlines as positive, negative, or neutral, we gain insight into how public sentiment may influence stock market movements.

🧠 Objective
To build an NLP model that:

Cleans and preprocesses stock-related news headlines

Applies sentiment analysis using VADER

Visualizes sentiment trends over time

Supports investment insight with data-driven sentiment indicators

📦 Features
🧹 Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering)

💬 Sentiment scoring using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)

📊 Visualizations:

Sentiment distribution

Time-series sentiment trends

Top headlines by sentiment
